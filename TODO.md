# Important things to do in **Data Understanding** according to:
* "Exploring data" (chapter 3 of the course book)
* Data understanding course slides

1. What king of attribute do we have?
    * Categorical, ordinal, continuous ...
2. Data quality
    * Wrong data, duplicates, missing, outliers ...
    ** Understand if the duplicates tweet with different id are the result of a bot user or an error
    ** Visualize how much our data quality has improved after cleaning.
    * syntactic accuracy
    * be careful to default values
    * we have to fix this before visualization and analisys
3. Visualization
    * Descriptive statistics tools
    ** fix the plots, because they really suck
4. Single attribute analisys
    * Central tendency, dispersion
    * single dimension outliers
5. Correlation analysis (multi attribute analisys)
    * Can we reduce the number of attributes finding dependencies?
    * box plot, scatter plot ...
    * also useful to detect multi dimensional outiers
    * pearson's correlation
    * compare the results eith the expected behaviour
6. Can we extract other useful attributes?

# Improvements in plots (Nice to have)
2. Rearranging the topics for the notebook so that it follows the coloumn names.



# Advanced topics

- Check if tweet has been made befor the creation date of the user account
- Decide the structure of this notebook (maybe current one could be too much rigid
